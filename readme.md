This script allows you to go through all files in a directory and either rename the file, or list how many lines are in the file. <br />
You are also asked if you want to rename your file. During the next running of this script it will display if any files have had their <br />
line count changed, or file name changed. <br />

#To use: simply prompt 'tool.sh directory_name'
